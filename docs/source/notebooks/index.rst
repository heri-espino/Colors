Notebook cookbook
=================

These notebooks are executable Sphinx pages. During the documentation build,
MyST-NB runs the code against the installed version of contrastcolors and
embeds the real Matplotlib outputs.

Refresh every notebook at once
------------------------------

You do not need to execute the notebooks one by one.

Locally:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install -e ".[docs]"
   python tools/execute_notebooks.py

The command executes every IPython notebook in docs/source/notebooks and writes
the generated figures and cell outputs back into the .ipynb files.

GitHub Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The manual workflow named ``refresh notebooks and site`` performs the entire
publication workflow in one run:

1. installs contrastcolors and the notebook dependencies;
2. executes all notebooks;
3. saves every output inside the notebooks;
4. commits changed .ipynb files back to the repository;
5. builds Sphinx from the stored outputs; and
6. deploys the refreshed GitHub Pages site.

Ordinary Sphinx builds reuse outputs already stored in notebooks. If a notebook
is missing its outputs, MyST-NB executes it automatically so that its figures
are visible on the documentation site. The manual refresh workflow remains the
way to commit all outputs permanently to the repository.

To publish the Sphinx site itself, configure GitHub Pages in Settings > Pages
with Source set to GitHub Actions, then run the refresh workflow. GitHub's
default Jekyll Pages workflow does not build these Sphinx pages.
